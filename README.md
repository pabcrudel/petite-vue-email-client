# Petite Vue Email Client SPA (Work in progress)

This project uses [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/api/) to generate a
user with the following information:

- Full name
- Email
- Username
- Profile picture

The proposal of this project is to create an Email Client SPA like `Gmail` or
`Outlook` using [Petite Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/petite-vue), a Vue.js
optimized version for [progressive
enhancement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement).

As soon as I continue working in this project I will explain here my thoughts
about this alternative distribution of Vue.
